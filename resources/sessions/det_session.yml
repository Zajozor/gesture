          During the session, you will be asked to record different gestures,
          each of them possibly multiple times.

          For each gesture you will be presented with an animation
          of the movement and the name of the gesture.
          Do not worry too much about exact interpretation,
          perform what you naturally feel the animation depicts.

          Between different gestures, you will be forced to take a break,
          to keep the measurements independent.

          On the next slide, you shall see an example to get hold of it,
          please equip the glove now if you haven't already.

              This is how a typical session slide will look,
              don't worry this one allows you to try things out,
              and does not count into the real data.

              Above you see the current data streamed from the glove.

              Next to it you see an animation depicting what
              movement you should perform.

              Try pressing space, performing the gesture once
              (see the progress bar)
              and then releasing space.
              On the right you can see your recorded gesture.
              Repeat it for each of the windows.

              If you made a mistake, you can click one of the windows
              and re-record the gesture.
              Otherwise, press enter to continue.
